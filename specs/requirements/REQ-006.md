# REQ-006: Distributed Rate Limiting System

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Active

## Purpose

This requirement addresses [JOB-004](../jobs/JOB-004.md) by providing a distributed rate limiting system that protects API resources from abuse while maintaining excellent performance and developer experience.

The system must support multiple rate limiting algorithms, client identification strategies, and quota management approaches to accommodate diverse API usage patterns and business models.

## Addresses

- [JOB-004](../jobs/JOB-004.md): Protect API Resources from Abuse

## Jobs Addressed

- **JOB-004**: Protect API Resources from Abuse

## Description

The distributed rate limiting system shall provide comprehensive protection against API abuse through configurable rate limits enforced at the API gateway layer. The system must operate with minimal latency overhead while maintaining consistency across distributed gateway instances.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Multiple Rate Limiting Algorithms**
   - Token bucket: Allow burst traffic up to bucket capacity
   - Leaky bucket: Smooth traffic at fixed rate
   - Fixed window: Simple quota per time period
   - Sliding window: More accurate than fixed window, prevents boundary gaming
   - Concurrent request limits: Control active connections

2. **Flexible Client Identification**
   - API key based (most accurate)
   - IP address based (for unauthenticated endpoints)
   - User ID based (for authenticated endpoints)
   - Custom header based (for specific use cases)
   - Composite keys (combination of multiple factors)

3. **Multi-Tier Quota Management**
   - Per-client quotas (individual API keys)
   - Per-endpoint quotas (resource-specific limits)
   - Per-tier quotas (free, pro, enterprise)
   - Global quotas (system-wide capacity limits)
   - Time-based quotas (hourly, daily, monthly)

4. **Distributed Consistency**
   - Shared state across gateway instances
   - Eventually consistent with bounded staleness
   - Graceful degradation when coordination unavailable
   - No single point of failure

5. **Observable and Manageable**
   - Real-time metrics on rate limit enforcement
   - Detailed logs for violation analysis
   - Configuration API for dynamic updates
   - Testing tools for policy validation

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:
- Rate limit decision latency: <5ms at p95
- Throughput: Support 100,000 requests/second per gateway instance
- Memory footprint: <100MB per million active quotas
- No performance degradation when limits not reached

**Scalability**:
- Horizontal scaling to 100+ gateway instances
- Support 1 million+ active quotas
- Handle traffic spikes of 10x normal load
- Linear performance scaling with additional instances

**Reliability**:
- 99.99% availability for rate limiting service
- Fail open if rate limiter unavailable (configurable)
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- No data loss during instance failures

**Security**:
- Prevent rate limit bypass through header manipulation
- Protect rate limiter itself from DoS attacks
- Audit trail for all quota modifications
- Encrypted storage for quota data

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Token Bucket Rate Limiting

**Given** a client with a token bucket limit of 100 requests per minute with burst capacity of 20
**When** the client makes 25 requests in the first second
**Then** the first 20 requests shall be accepted immediately (burst)
**And** the remaining 5 requests shall be rate limited
**And** the client shall be able to make approximately 1.67 requests per second thereafter

### AC-02: Client Identification by API Key

**Given** multiple requests from different IP addresses with the same API key
**When** the rate limiter evaluates these requests
**Then** all requests shall be counted against the same quota
**And** the quota shall be identified by the API key regardless of source IP
**And** requests without an API key shall be counted separately per IP address

### AC-03: Per-Tier Quota Enforcement

**Given** a free tier client with 1000 requests per hour limit
**And** a pro tier client with 100,000 requests per hour limit
**When** both clients make concurrent requests
**Then** each client's requests shall be counted against their respective tier limits
**And** the free tier client shall be rate limited at 1000 requests
**And** the pro tier client shall be rate limited at 100,000 requests
**And** one tier's usage shall not affect the other tier's quota

### AC-04: Distributed Consistency

**Given** a client quota of 1000 requests per minute
**And** the client's requests are distributed across 10 gateway instances
**When** the client makes 1100 requests within one minute distributed evenly across gateways
**Then** approximately 100 requests shall be rate limited
**And** the rate limiting decision shall be consistent within 5% error margin
**And** no single gateway shall allow significantly more requests than others

### AC-05: Rate Limit Headers in Response

**Given** a client making requests to a rate limited endpoint
**When** the API gateway returns a response
**Then** the response shall include an "X-RateLimit-Limit" header showing the quota limit
**And** the response shall include an "X-RateLimit-Remaining" header showing remaining quota
**And** the response shall include an "X-RateLimit-Reset" header showing reset timestamp
**And** when rate limited, the response shall return HTTP 429 status code

### AC-06: Sliding Window Accuracy

**Given** a client with a sliding window limit of 100 requests per minute
**When** the client makes 100 requests in second 0
**And** the client makes 50 requests in second 59
**And** the client makes 50 requests in second 61
**Then** the requests in second 0 shall be accepted
**And** the requests in second 59 shall be accepted
**And** the requests in second 61 shall be partially rate limited
**And** the sliding window shall prevent boundary gaming

### AC-07: Dynamic Configuration Updates

**Given** a rate limit policy of 1000 requests per minute is currently active
**When** an administrator updates the policy to 2000 requests per minute via the API
**Then** the new policy shall take effect within 10 seconds
**And** all gateway instances shall apply the updated limit
**And** in-flight requests shall not be affected by the update
**And** the update shall be logged in the audit trail

### AC-08: Per-Endpoint Rate Limits

**Given** a resource-intensive endpoint "/api/reports" with a limit of 10 requests per minute
**And** a standard endpoint "/api/users" with a limit of 1000 requests per minute
**When** a client makes 20 requests to "/api/reports" and 500 requests to "/api/users"
**Then** the "/api/reports" requests shall be counted separately from "/api/users" requests
**And** 10 requests to "/api/reports" shall be rate limited
**And** 0 requests to "/api/users" shall be rate limited

### AC-09: Graceful Degradation

**Given** the distributed rate limiter backend (Redis) becomes unavailable
**When** requests arrive at the API gateway
**Then** the gateway shall log an error indicating rate limiter unavailability
**And** if configured to fail open, the gateway shall allow all requests through
**And** if configured to fail closed, the gateway shall apply local in-memory limits
**And** when the backend recovers, the gateway shall resume distributed rate limiting

### AC-10: Concurrent Request Limits

**Given** a client with a concurrent request limit of 5
**When** the client initiates 10 simultaneous long-running requests
**Then** the first 5 requests shall be accepted and processed
**And** the remaining 5 requests shall receive HTTP 429 status immediately
**And** when one of the first 5 requests completes, one waiting request shall be accepted
**And** the concurrent count shall be accurately maintained across request lifecycles

### AC-11: Rate Limit Metrics and Monitoring

**Given** the rate limiting system is processing requests
**When** rate limiting decisions are made
**Then** metrics shall be emitted for total requests evaluated per second
**And** metrics shall be emitted for requests rate limited per second
**And** metrics shall be emitted for rate limit decision latency (p50, p95, p99)
**And** metrics shall include labels for tier, endpoint, and client
**And** metrics shall be queryable in the monitoring dashboard

### AC-12: Burst Allowance Configuration

**Given** a token bucket rate limit configured with base rate 100/min and burst capacity 50
**When** a client has been idle for 2 minutes
**Then** the client's token bucket shall be full with 50 tokens
**And** the client shall be able to make 50 requests immediately
**And** after the burst, tokens shall replenish at 100 per minute
**And** the burst capacity shall not exceed the configured maximum

## Dependencies

This requirement depends on:
- Infrastructure for distributed state management (Redis or equivalent)
- API gateway capable of executing rate limiting logic
- Monitoring and metrics collection system
- Configuration management system for policy updates

## Notes

**Algorithm Selection Guidance**:
- Use **token bucket** for APIs with legitimate burst traffic (mobile apps, batch jobs)
- Use **leaky bucket** for APIs requiring smooth, predictable load
- Use **fixed window** for simple use cases where accuracy less critical
- Use **sliding window** when accuracy is critical and boundary gaming is a concern
- Use **concurrent limits** for long-running operations (file uploads, webhless)

**Performance Considerations**:
- Redis clustering recommended for high availability and horizontal scaling
- Consider local caching to reduce Redis roundtrips for frequently checked quotas
- Use pipelining for batch quota checks when possible
- Monitor Redis latency and add read replicas if needed

**Future Enhancements**:
- Machine learning based anomaly detection for automated limit adjustment
- Predictive scaling based on historical usage patterns
- Cost-based rate limiting (charge based on computational cost, not just requests)
- Geographic rate limiting (different limits per region)
- Time-of-day based limits (higher limits during business hours)
