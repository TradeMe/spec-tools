# JOB-004: Protect API Resources from Abuse

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Active

## Context

API providers face constant threats from malicious actors, misbehaving clients, and accidental traffic spikes that can overwhelm their infrastructure. Without proper rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms, a single bad actor or misconfigured client can consume all available resources, causing service degradation or complete outages for legitimate users.

Traditional approaches to rate limiting are often too simple (basic request counting) or too complex (requiring custom implementation and ongoing maintenance). API teams need a solution that provides sophisticated protection without requiring deep expertise in distributed systems.

Modern APIs serve diverse clients with varying usage patterns - mobile apps with unpredictable bursts, batch processing systems with sustained high loads, and interactive web applications with steady traffic. A one-size-fits-all approach fails to accommodate these different needs while maintaining fair resource allocation.

## Job Story

**When** I'm operating an API that serves multiple clients with varying usage patterns,

**I want to** automatically enforce fair usage limits that prevent resource exhaustion while accommodating legitimate traffic bursts,

**So that** all users receive reliable service and malicious or misbehaving clients cannot impact overall system availability.

### Related Job Stories

**When** I'm investigating an incident or unusual traffic pattern,

**I want to** quickly identify which clients are being rate limited and why,

**So that** I can distinguish between legitimate issues and abuse attempts.

**When** I'm onboarding a new high-value customer with special requirements,

**I want to** easily configure custom rate limits that match their usage tier,

**So that** they receive appropriate service levels without manual intervention.

**When** I'm planning capacity for an upcoming product launch or marketing campaign,

**I want to** temporarily adjust rate limits to accommodate expected traffic increases,

**So that** legitimate users aren't blocked during high-demand periods.

## Pains

### Current Pain Points

1. **Service Outages from Resource Exhaustion**
   - A single misbehaving client consumes all available API capacity
   - Database connections exhaust, causing cascading failures
   - Recovery requires manual intervention and service restarts
   - Legitimate users experience timeouts and errors
   - **Impact**: Loss of revenue, damaged reputation, emergency escalations

2. **Crude Rate Limiting is Ineffective**
   - Simple per-IP limits easily bypassed by distributed attacks
   - Fixed limits don't account for legitimate traffic bursts
   - All-or-nothing blocking frustrates legitimate users
   - Requires extensive custom code for different client tiers
   - **Impact**: False positives block good users, false negatives allow abuse

3. **Lack of Visibility into Usage Patterns**
   - Cannot identify which clients are hitting limits
   - No historical data on rate limit violations
   - Difficult to determine appropriate limit values
   - Cannot distinguish malicious traffic from legitimate spikes
   - **Impact**: Reactive rather than proactive management

4. **Complex Implementation and Maintenance**
   - Rate limiting logic scattered across multiple services
   - Distributed rate limiting requires Redis or similar infrastructure
   - Different rate limiting strategies for different endpoints
   - Configuration changes require code deployments
   - **Impact**: High development cost, slow iteration, maintenance burden

5. **Unfair Resource Distribution**
   - Premium customers get same limits as free tier users
   - Cannot prioritize critical traffic during resource constraints
   - No graceful degradation when approaching limits
   - Batch processes starve interactive requests
   - **Impact**: Poor customer experience, revenue loss, competitive disadvantage

6. **Difficulty Communicating Limits to Clients**
   - API consumers don't know their limits until hitting them
   - No standard way to communicate remaining quota
   - Retry logic difficult to implement correctly
   - Documentation doesn't match actual limits
   - **Impact**: Poor developer experience, support burden, integration delays

## Gains

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Automatic Protection Against Resource Exhaustion**
   - API remains available even under attack or abuse
   - Fair resource allocation across all clients
   - Graceful degradation instead of complete failure
   - Self-healing without manual intervention
   - **Value**: 99.99% uptime, reduced operational burden, cost savings

2. **Flexible, Policy-Based Rate Limiting**
   - Different limits for different client tiers (free, pro, enterprise)
   - Endpoint-specific limits for resource-intensive operations
   - Time-based limits (per second, minute, hour, day)
   - Burst allowances for temporary traffic spikes
   - **Value**: Accommodates diverse usage patterns, better user experience

3. **Comprehensive Usage Analytics**
   - Real-time dashboard showing rate limit metrics
   - Historical trends and violation patterns
   - Client-level usage insights
   - Alerting when approaching limits
   - **Value**: Data-driven capacity planning, proactive issue detection

4. **Simple Configuration and Management**
   - Declarative rate limit policies
   - No code changes required for limit adjustments
   - Centralized management console
   - A/B testing for optimal limit values
   - **Value**: Faster iteration, lower maintenance cost, reduced errors

5. **Transparent Communication with API Consumers**
   - Standard HTTP headers showing limits and remaining quota
   - Clear error messages when limits exceeded
   - Documentation auto-generated from policies
   - SDKs with built-in retry logic
   - **Value**: Better developer experience, fewer support tickets, faster integration

6. **Business Model Enablement**
   - Tiered access levels drive revenue
   - Usage-based pricing supported automatically
   - Upgrade prompts when approaching limits
   - Analytics for pricing optimization
   - **Value**: New revenue streams, improved monetization, customer growth
